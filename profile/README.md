## 🚀 What is Xpell?

Xpell is an open-source framework for building real-time applications, dashboards, and AI-driven user interfaces.

It combines:

- **Xpell Server** – real-time backend and module system  
- **Wormholes** – ultra-fast live communication between server ↔ client  
- **Xpell-UI** – declarative JSON UI engine (XView)  
- **Vibe Coding** – generate UI from natural-language prompts  

Xpell is designed for developers building AI agents, internal tools, control panels, and dynamic business applications.

## 🌌 Why Xpell?

Traditional web frameworks weren't built for the age of AI.

Xpell enables:
- AI-generated UIs  
- Real-time data-driven components  
- Dynamic dashboards and workflows  
- Low-code + no-code development  
- UI created and updated by agents  

Xpell is **Next.js for AI-native apps**.
