## 🚀 What is Xpell?

**Xpell is an open-source full-stack framework for building AI-driven applications.**

It combines:

- **Xpell Server** — real-time backend runtime & module engine  
- **Wormholes Protocol** — low-latency server ↔ client live communication  
- **Xpell-UI (XView Engine)** — declarative JSON-based UI renderer  
- **Vibe Coding** — generate UI instantly from natural language prompts  

Together, these components let developers create dynamic dashboards, internal tools, workflows, and full AI agent interfaces — with minimal code.

## ✨ Why Xpell?

Traditional frameworks like React / Next.js weren't built for the AI generation.

Xpell introduces:

### 🔹 AI-Generated and AI-Editable UI  
Agents can create, modify, and operate user interfaces in real time.

### 🔹 Real-Time State & Data  
Wormholes keeps server logic and UI perfectly in sync.

### 🔹 Declarative XView JSON  
A simple, AI-friendly format for UI building — easy to generate or edit.

### 🔹 Full-Stack by Design  
Server, client, protocol, and UI schema work together seamlessly.

👉 **Think of Xpell as “Next.js + React — reimagined for AI agents.”**
